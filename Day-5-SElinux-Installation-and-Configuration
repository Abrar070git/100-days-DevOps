QUESTION:

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:

Install the required SELinux packages.

Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.

No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.

Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

SOLUTION:

ssh banner@Stapp03
sudo -i

sudo yum install -y libselinux libselinux-utils policycoreutils selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted   -----> install this package

SELINUX=enforcing 	------> change it to disbled

No Reboot Required Now
As noted, reboot will be handled during scheduled maintenance.
