QUESTION:

As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named ravi requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:


Create a user named ravi on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-02-17, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

SOLUTION:

ssh steve@stapp02
sudo -i

useradd --help   -------> look for expire date

useradd -e 2024-02-17 ravi

cat /etc/passwd | grep -i ravi
or
getent passwd ravi
ravi:x:1002:1002::/home/ravi:/bin/bash

chage -l ravi   ----------> chage --help to look for all the options
