QUESTION:

In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.


Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.

SOLUTION:

ssh steve@stapp02
sudo -i

cd /tmp/
chmod a+x xfusioncorp.sh
./xfusioncorp.sh

ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
