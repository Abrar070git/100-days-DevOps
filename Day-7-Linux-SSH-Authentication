QUESTION:

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:

Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

SOLUTION:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

Breakdown:

Part		Meaning
ssh-keygen	The tool used to generate, manage, and convert SSH keys.
-t rsa		Specifies the type of key to generate. rsa is a common encryption algorithm.
-b 2048		Specifies the key length in bits. 2048 bits is the minimum recommended size for RSA keys for secure authentication.

ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03

Test SSH Connectivity:
Verify that you can SSH into each server without a password:

ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03
